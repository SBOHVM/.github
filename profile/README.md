## SBOHVM

This organisation is run by members of [School of Biodiversity, One Health and Veterinary Medicine][sbohvm] in the
[College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences][mvls] at the [University of Glasgow][uofg]. At the moment it
contains the material for teaching the [Reproducible Programming in R (RPiR)][rpir] course, led by [Richard Reeve][rr]
([GitHub][rr-gh]), which forms part of two of our Masters courses - [Quantitative Methods in Biodiversity, Conservation
and Epidemiology (QMBCE)][qmbce] and [Conservation Management of African Ecosystems (CMAE)][cmae] - as well as private
repositories created by our students.

The main repository for teaching the RPiR course is [here][rpir-gh]. It is a self-contained R package on GitHub which
contains all of the course materials, including the lectures and tutorial exercises, which can be [easily installed][install]
using CRAN's [`devtools`][devtools] package.
